Hey, I'm Jordan Fowler, a 5th generation Montanan and software engineer since 2000. It's a gift to find a lifelong passion for such a dynamic field, as it forces one to continuously learn and adapt. I view the role of a technologist in society as one who works to *do more* **with less** and why our skills are highly valued.
