After hosting my personal website at [about.me](https://about.me) for the last four years, I decided to switch to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for greater freedom and flexibility. I've built this basic website using the static website generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Doing so has allowed me to fully customize my website very easily using a basic Git workflow.
